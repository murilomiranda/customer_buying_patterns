Mr. Goodrich from VP of Sales wants to make some marketing activities and some changes to the website. 
He hypothesized that:

(1) customers who shop in the store are older than customers who shop online and  
(2) older people spend more money on our products than younger people. 

Another hypothesis raided by Sherman is: the differences in transactions and customer demographics might be regional. 
The goal of this analysis is to understand how our customer spend their money in our locations (store/online) in order to maximize the amount of revenue.
